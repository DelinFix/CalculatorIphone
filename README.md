<h2>It seems to me that everyone knows how to use a calculator, but I'll tell you what my calculator can do</h2>

Add:
```
42 + 42 = 84
```
Deduct:
```
42 - 42 = 0
```
Multiply:
```
42 * 42 = 1764
```
Divide:
```
42 / 42 = 1
```
Find the remainder of the division:
```
42 % 42 = 0
```
Do calculations with fractional numbers:
